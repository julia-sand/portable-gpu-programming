# Dot product with Kokkos parallel dispatch

In this exercise you can practice implementing the simple dot product
$x \cdot y = \sum_i x[i] * y[i]$ in parallel using Kokkos. In order to focus only on
parallel dispatch, the proper way to manage memory with Kokkos is not considered yet.

## Tasks

The code [dot-product.cpp](dot-product.cpp) implements dot product in standard C/C++. 
Replace the `for` loops by corresponding Kokkos parallel operation and the computational body by
lambda function.

1. Build and run the code in Roihu with cuda backend. You can use your own Kokkos installation
or use the module
```
module use /projappl/project_2019754/modules
module load kokkos/5.2.0/cuda
```

2. Build and run the code in LUMI with OpenMP backend. You can use your own Kokkos installation
or use the module
```
module use /projappl/project_462001610/modules
module load kokkos/5.2.0/omp
```

3. Build and run the code in LUMI with HIP backend. You can use your own Kokkos installation
or use the module
```
module use /projappl/project_462001610/modules
module load kokkos/5.2.0/hip
```
   - Can you explain why the code fails at run time?
   - In AMD systems one can control automatic data migration between host and device memories
     with `HSA_XNACK` environment variable
   - Try to set `export HSA_XNACK=1` before running the code, does it work now?
