# Using Kokkos with MPI

In this exercise you can practice building and running a program combining Kokkos
and MPI. You will also see how Kokkos is mapping MPI tasks to GPUs.

## Tasks for Roihu-GPU

Build the [hello.cpp](hello.cpp) code with the provided `CMakeList.txt` using the CUDA backend.
Run the program on two nodes with two tasks and two GPUs on each node i.e.
```
...
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:gh200:2
...

srun ./build-cuda/hello
```

The output is pretty verbose, as all MPI tasks print information about all the GPUs available in their nodes.
You can, however, see which GPU was selected for each MPI tasks by grepping both the MPI rank and "selected":
```
egrep 'rank|Selected' slurm-xxxx.out
```

## Tasks for LUMI

Build the [hello.cpp](hello.cpp) code with the provided `CMakeList.txt` using the HIP backend.
Run the program on two nodes with two tasks and two GPUs on each node i.e.
```
...
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=2
#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=2
...

srun ./build-hip/hello
```

The output is pretty verbose, as all MPI tasks print information about all the GPUs available in their nodes.
You can, however, see which GPU was selected for each MPI tasks by grepping both the MPI rank and "selected":
```
egrep 'rank|Selected' slurm-xxxx.out
```
