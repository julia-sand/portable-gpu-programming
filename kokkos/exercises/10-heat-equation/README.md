# Solving two dimensional heat equation with Kokkos

The repository https://github.com/cschpc/heat-equation contains various implementations
for solving the heat equation, including a Kokkos version under **kokkos** subdirectories of the repository.

Clone the repository to a location of your choice with
```
git clone https://github.com/cschpc/heat-equation.git
```
and go to the Kokkos version:
```
cd heat-equation/2d/kokkos
```

Have a look how Kokkos is used in the code, pay special attention how the possible
different data layouts are treated in the context of MPI communication (`core.cpp`).
(Note that this is not necessarily the only or even optimum solution).

Try to build and run the code in the system of your choice (or in both Roihu and LUMI).
Try different number of GPUs and investigate the performance.

Note: the code relies on GPU-aware MPI communication, so in LUMI `MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED` 
needs to be set when running, *i.e.*
```
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=true
srun ... --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=8 --gpus-per-node=8 ./heat_kokkos
```
